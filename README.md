# ML

Repository for CS 4375 (Machine Learning) course

## Overview of ML

This is a brief overview of ML and why I am taking this course.

You can see the document [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW0/Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## C++ Data Summarization Functions

This is a C++ program that includes functions for summarizing data loaded into a vector.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW1/hw1.cpp).

You can see an overview document [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW1/HW1_Overview.pdf).

## Linear Regression and Classification in R

This is a pair of R notebooks, one exploring linear regression and the other exploring classification. Each notebook uses a different dataset.

You can see the linear regression notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.pdf).

You can see the classification notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Classification.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.pdf).

You can see the datasets [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/data).

## Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in C++

This is a pair of C++ programs that implement Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms.

You can see the logistic regression code [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW3/logreg.cpp).

You can see the Naive Bayes code [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW3/naivebayes.cpp).

You can see an overview document [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW3/HW3_Overview.pdf).

## Searching for Similarity with R

This is a set of R notebooks that explore the use of kNN and decision trees for regression and classification; k-means, hierarchical, and model-based clustering; and PCA and LDA dimensionality reduction.

You can see the classification notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Classification.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Classification.pdf).

You can see the clustering notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Clustering.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Clustering.pdf).

You can see the dimensionality reduction notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Dimensionality_Reduction.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf).

You can see the datasets [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW4/data).
