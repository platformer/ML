## Linear Regression and Classification in R

This is a pair of R notebooks, one exploring linear regression and the other exploring classification. Each notebook uses a different dataset.

You can see the linear regression notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.pdf).

You can see the classification notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Classification.Rmd).

You can see a pdf of the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/ML/blob/main/HW2/Regression.pdf).
